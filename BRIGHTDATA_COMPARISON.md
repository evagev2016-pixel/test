- Revenue per impression: $0.002365 (unchanged)

**Cost per result**: $0.0015 ($1.5 ÷ 1,000)

**Cost per result**: $0.001 ($1 ÷ 1,000)

**To achieve $100/day profit:**

- **Impressions needed**: 73,260 impressions/day
  - Calculation: $100 profit ÷ $0.001365 profit per impression = 73,260
  - Profit per impression: $0.002365 revenue - $0.001 cost = $0.001365
  
- **Daily cost**: $73.26
  - Calculation: 73,260 impressions × $0.001 per impression
  
- **Daily revenue**: $173.26
  - Calculation: 73,260 impressions × $0.002365 per impression
  
- **Daily profit**: $100.00 ✓
  - Calculation: $173.26 revenue - $73.26 cost

**Monthly cost**: $2,197.80/day × 30 = $65,934/month (if using full 2M results)
**Note**: The $1,999/month plan includes 2M results, so actual cost depends on usage

- Impressions: 254,455/day
- Cost: $101.78/day
- Revenue: $601.78/day
- Profit: $500.00/day

- Cost: $366.30/day
- Revenue: $866.30/day
- Profit: $500.00/day

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

1. **Web Unlocker API might be designed for different use cases** (unlocking blocked pages, not general web scraping)
2. **Verify if "results" = impressions** in your use case
3. **Check if Web Unlocker has any additional features** that justify the higher cost
4. **Consider if Web Unlocker provides better success rates** that could offset higher costs

---

## 🔍 Next Steps

1. **Verify Web Unlocker pricing** - confirm $1/1K or $1.5/1K is the correct rate
2. **Check monthly commitment** - The $1/1K plan requires $1,999/month (2M results included)
3. **Test Web Unlocker** - see if it provides better success rates
4. **Compare success rates** - if Web Unlocker has 2.5x better success rate, costs might be comparable
5. **Calculate break-even** - At $1/1K, you'd need 2.5x better success rate to match current proxy costs

---

## 💰 Updated Recommendation: $1/1K Plan

**At $1 per 1K results, the Web Unlocker is closer but still more expensive:**

- **3.6x more expensive** than current proxy ($73.26 vs $20.36/day)
- **Still requires 1.44x more impressions** (73,260 vs 50,891/day)
- **Lower profit margin** (57.7% vs 83%)
- **But much better than $1.5/1K** - only 3.6x vs 8.5x more expensive

**However, consider:**
- The $1/1K plan requires **$1,999/month commitment** (2M results)
- If you're not using 2M results/month, you're paying for unused capacity
- Current proxy is **pay-as-you-go** - only pay for what you use

**Break-even analysis:**
- If Web Unlocker provides **2.5x better success rate** (fewer failed requests), costs become comparable
- If Web Unlocker prevents **blocking/detection issues**, it might be worth the extra cost
- If you're already hitting **rate limits** with residential proxies, Web Unlocker might be necessary
